## About this app
This is an auto summarizer app for text articles, extracting the most important information by using NLP algorithms. Apart from giving the summary, it also enables us to listen the content which has been summarized. It helps us to save time in our busy schedules who prefer to read/listen the summary of those articles before we decide to jump in for reading the entire article.

## How it works
- Summarize for Text helps you to summarize the huge text into brief content
- Summarize for URL helps you to summarize the content in the URL into brief content
- Automated Summarization allows you to select the number of sentences which you want to have a look
- Visualize the keywords in the text for easy understanding of the context behind the article
